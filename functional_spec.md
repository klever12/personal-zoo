# Personal Zoo CLI Introduction
The Personal Zoo CLI app provides users a simulation of a personal zoo of unique animals.

## User Stories

- As someone adding a unique animal to the zoo, I would like to provide the species and name, so they can be referenced using them.
- As the owner of the personal zoo, I would like to check in on each animal, so I can see what they are up to. 

### Continuous Operations
- As a user, I want to perform multiple actions without restarting the application, so that I can interact with the personal zoo continously.

### Functional Requirements
- The application must allow the user to interact with the personal zoo by inputting specific integers mapped to actions.
